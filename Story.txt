his father is disabled man and his mother work as a maid, His house totally dependend on his mothers
income only. He was so poor that every villagers including school teachers made fun of his poor condition. 
One day he went to a cinema hall to watch a newly released movie name "Vastab". After watching the movie
he relate the story to his real life and felt that this movie is made on his life. Then he started behave
like reel life villain which was the main character of the movie. Then he started murdering innocent people, 
money extortion and terrorizing the village. After that he influanced others who were suffered from same condition.
because of that he got arrested many times and went to jail. One day when he was in jail that time one reel life
villain name Sonu Sood came to motivate criminals to do good work in socity. Then he realised reel life villains 
are also like a normal human and they are also very good persons in real life. When he released from jail
after that he started doing good work like charity, education and helped poor people, orphanes and old aged people.

Moral of the story :- We sould not blindly follow reel life charecters, there are many movies based on villain story.
                      Reel life and real life both are indirectly related to each other, reel life villain dont impact directly
                      on socity but real life villain impact directly on the socity.
